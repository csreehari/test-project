            <p>Ferrero Rocher was introduced in 1982 in Europe. Shortly after its release, production was halted due to a problem with label printing. Michele Ferrero, the credited inventor, named the chocolate after a grotto in the Roman Catholic shrine of Lourdes, Rocher de Massabielle. Rocher comes from French and means rock or boulder.

                Ferrero Rocher is a chocolate sweet made by Italian chocolatier Ferrero SpA. The chocolates consist of a whole roasted hazelnut encased in a thin wafer shell filled with hazelnut cream including vegetable oil and covered in milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts.[1] The sweets each contain 73 calories, and are individually packaged inside a gold-colored wrapper.
                
                . There are many flavors and so far, the only discontinued flavor is Ferrero Fresco Mint.
                
                The ingredients that can be found in the chocolates are:
                
                Almond Flour
                Vanilla Protein Powder
                Dates
                Dark Chocolate
                Cocoa Powder
                Hazelnuts
                Desiccated Coconut
                Chia Seeds
